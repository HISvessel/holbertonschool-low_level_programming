This repository is for all the projects on the topic of variadic functions. hese functions are described as being one that can take any number of parameters aside of at least one set or fixed parameter in its function. In order to perform this passing if variable parameters, we declare the function with an ellipsis at the end of the parameter section(...) and we input them by utilizing the macros contained in the stdargs.h header file: va_start, va_list, va_agrs and va_end. The journey continues,  is fun.
