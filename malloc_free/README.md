IN this repository, we begin to discuss the concept of malloc, calloc, realloc and free, functions contained within the stlib.h library. Malloc is the memory allocation of a determined data type which is done at runtime instead of a compile time; this allocation is performed in a heap, a block of memory where the user has control of allocation snd deallocation. Calloc performs as a similarfunction, but instead it takes advantage of its capacity to initialize number of elements so that they are placed continguously in memory, which makes it more structured than malloc, where you initialize by storing the amount of data, in bytes, that you need to use. Realloc is a function that allows dynamically allocated memory to be resized in the event tht someting bigger is needed at runtime. And since all of these memory blocks were initialized by the user, it is important that the user frees the amount of memory in which they have allocated said memory. Thats where free enters the equation, which is to release the memory allocated. This is a crucial part to avoid dangling memory, memory leaks, wasted memory and corruption of program.
